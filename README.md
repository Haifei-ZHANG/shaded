## Shapley value-based deceptive evidence detection in belief functions

Deceptive evidence detection is an important issue in the theory of belief functions, which can be used to solve the problem of conflicts between evidence and to assess the credibility of evidence sources. 

In this paper, we first give the definitions of strong and weak deceptive evidence. Then, we propose a deceptive evidence detection approach that directly investigates the process of Dempster's combination rule and decision-making strategy, can distinguish between strong and weak deceptive evidence, and gives the importance of each piece of evidence.
